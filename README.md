Newly Design App with latest tech.
first you have to download zip of this project
this project is double time zipped when you download zip sorry for this in advance.
check node version it should be v22.14.0
run #npm install
run #npm run dev
if any further query email me at kmuhammadareeb@gmail.com
my assumptions are pretty much clear and meets the goal which state down in the requirement pdf.
which is to make a dashboard so advance that it can show my sites traffic in one place with graph/Charts.
so i do not need to go one by one on my several websites to check-In.
i believe it is what required from my side and it is what i delivered.
please go through code once and do tell me or guide me to what and where i can perform better or enhanced it.
thanks.
